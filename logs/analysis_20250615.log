Title: Pushing the Limits of Extreme Weather: Constructing Extreme Heatwave
  Storylines with Differentiable Climate Models
Summary (EN): Understanding the plausible upper bounds of extreme weather events is
essential for risk assessment in a warming climate. Existing methods, based on
large ensembles of physics-based models, are often computationally expensive or
lack the fidelity needed to simulate rare, high-impact extremes. Here,  ...

Title: Demystifying Spectral Feature Learning for Instrumental Variable
  Regression
Summary (EN): We address the problem of causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden
confounders, using nonparametric instrumental variable (IV) regression. A
leading strategy employs spectral features - that is, learned features spanning
the top eigensubspaces of the operator linking treatments to instrume ...

Title: Coupled reaction and diffusion governing interface evolution in
  solid-state batteries
Summary (EN): Understanding and controlling the atomistic-level reactions governing the
formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for the
viability of next-generation solid state batteries. However, challenges persist
due to difficulties in experimentally characterizing buried interfaces and
 ...

Title: The Gittins Index: A Design Principle for Decision-Making Under
  Uncertainty
Summary (EN): The Gittins index is a tool that optimally solves a variety of
decision-making problems involving uncertainty, including multi-armed bandit
problems, minimizing mean latency in queues, and search problems like the
Pandora's box model. However, despite the above examples and later extensions
thereof, ...
