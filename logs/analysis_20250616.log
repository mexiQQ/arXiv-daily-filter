tasks, and extremely robust rotation estimation is significantly useful for
safety-critical applications. Typically, estimating a rotation is considered a
non-linear and non-convex optimization problem that requires careful de ...

Title: Approximating the total variation distance between spin systems
Summary (EN): Spin systems form an important class of undirected graphical models. For two
Gibbs distributions $\mu$ and $\nu$ induced by two spin systems on the same
graph $G = (V, E)$, we study the problem of approximating the total variation
distance $d_{TV}(\mu,\nu)$ with an $\epsilon$-relative error. We prop ...

Title: Stationary distribution of node2vec random walks on household models
Summary (EN): The node2vec random walk has proven to be a key tool in network embedding
algorithms. These random walks are tuneable, and their transition probabilities
depend on the previous visited node and on the triangles containing the current
and the previously visited node. Even though these walks are widel ...
