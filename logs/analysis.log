Title: Diving into Self-Evolving Training for Multimodal Reasoning
Authors: Wei Liu, Junlong Li, Xiwen Zhang, Fan Zhou, Yu Cheng, Junxian He
Published: 2024-12-23T10:18:41Z
PDF: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17451v2
Summary: Self-evolving trainin--where models iteratively learn from their own
outputs--has emerged as a key approach for complex reasoning tasks, addressing
the scarcity of high-quality chain-of-thought data. However, its effectiveness
in multimodal reasoning, a domain more intricate than text-only reasoning ...
