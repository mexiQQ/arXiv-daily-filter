Summary (EN): Many engineering and scientific fields have recently become interested in
modeling terms in partial differential equations (PDEs) with neural networks.
The resulting neural-network PDE model, being a function of the neural network
parameters, can be calibrated to available data by optimizing over th ...

Title: Connecting phases of matter to the flatness of the loss landscape in
  analog variational quantum algorithms
Summary (EN): Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) promise near-term quantum advantage,
yet parametrized quantum states commonly built from the digital gate-based
approach often suffer from scalability issues such as barren plateaus, where
the loss landscape becomes flat. We study an analog VQA ans\"atze compose ...

Title: Estimation of Treatment Effects in Extreme and Unobserved Data
Summary (EN): Causal effect estimation seeks to determine the impact of an intervention
from observational data. However, the existing causal inference literature
primarily addresses treatment effects on frequently occurring events. But what
if we are interested in estimating the effects of a policy intervention  ...

Title: Evolutionary chemical learning in dimerization networks
Summary (EN): We present a novel framework for chemical learning based on Competitive
Dimerization Networks (CDNs) - systems in which multiple molecular species,
e.g. proteins or DNA/RNA oligomers, reversibly bind to form dimers. We show
that these networks can be trained in vitro through directed evolution,
enab ...
