Title: Enhancing generalizability of model discovery across parameter space
  with multi-experiment equation learning (ME-EQL)
Summary (EN): Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a powerful tool for understanding
self-organizing biological systems, but it is computationally intensive and
often not analytically tractable. Equation learning (EQL) methods can derive
continuum models from ABM data, but they typically require extensive
simulations fo ...

Title: Local MDI+: Local Feature Importances for Tree-Based Models
Summary (EN): Tree-based ensembles such as random forests remain the go-to for tabular data
over deep learning models due to their prediction performance and computational
efficiency. These advantages have led to their widespread deployment in
high-stakes domains, where interpretability is essential for ensuring
 ...

Title: Protriever: End-to-End Differentiable Protein Homology Search for
  Fitness Prediction
Summary (EN): Retrieving homologous protein sequences is essential for a broad range of
protein modeling tasks such as fitness prediction, protein design, structure
modeling, and protein-protein interactions. Traditional workflows have relied
on a two-step process: first retrieving homologs via Multiple Sequence

Title: Spiking Neural Models for Decision-Making Tasks with Learning
Summary (EN): In cognition, response times and choices in decision-making tasks are
commonly modeled using Drift Diffusion Models (DDMs), which describe the
accumulation of evidence for a decision as a stochastic process, specifically a
Brownian motion, with the drift rate reflecting the strength of the evidence. ...

Summary (EN): Recent discoveries have suggested that the promising avenue of using
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels in blood samples provides reasonable
accuracy for cancer monitoring, with extremely low burden on the patient's
side. It is known that the presence of ctDNA can result from various mechanisms
le ...

Title: TTrace: Lightweight Error Checking and Diagnosis for Distributed
  Training
Summary (EN): Distributed training is essential for scaling the training of large neural
network models, such as large language models (LLMs), across thousands of GPUs.
However, the complexity of distributed training programs makes them
particularly prone to silent bugs, which do not produce explicit error signal ...

Title: Surrogate models to optimize plasma assisted atomic layer deposition in
  high aspect ratio features
Summary (EN): In this work we explore surrogate models to optimize plasma enhanced atomic
layer deposition (PEALD) in high aspect ratio features. In plasma-based
processes such as PEALD and atomic layer etching, surface recombination can
dominate the reactivity of plasma species with the surface, which can lead t ...

Title: Adversarial Surrogate Risk Bounds for Binary Classification
Summary (EN): A central concern in classification is the vulnerability of machine learning
models to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is one of the most popular
techniques for training robust classifiers, which involves minimizing an
adversarial surrogate risk. Recent work characterized when a minimizing ...

Title: Lower Bounds for Learning Quantum States with Single-Copy Measurements
Summary (EN): We study the problems of quantum tomography and shadow tomography using
measurements performed on individual, identical copies of an unknown
$d$-dimensional state. We first revisit a known lower bound due to Haah et al.
(2017) on quantum tomography with accuracy $\epsilon$ in trace distance, when
