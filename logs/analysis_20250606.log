Title: Why Johnny Signs with Next-Generation Tools: A Usability Case Study of
  Sigstore
Summary (EN): Software signing is the most robust method for ensuring the integrity and
authenticity of components in a software supply chain. However, traditional
signing tools place key management and signer identification burdens on
practitioners, leading to both security vulnerabilities and usability
challeng ...

Title: Quantum Secure Key Exchange with Position-based Credentials
Summary (EN): Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides an information-theoretic way of
securely exchanging secret keys, and typically relies on pre-shared keys or
public keys for message authentication. To lift the requirement of pre-shared
or public keys, Buhrman et. al. [SIAM J. Comput. 43, 150 (2014)] proposed

Title: Mono: Is Your "Clean" Vulnerability Dataset Really Solvable? Exposing
  and Trapping Undecidable Patches and Beyond
Summary (EN): The quantity and quality of vulnerability datasets are essential for
developing deep learning solutions to vulnerability-related tasks. Due to the
limited availability of vulnerabilities, a common approach to building such
datasets is analyzing security patches in source code. However, existing
secu ...

Title: Depermissioning Web3: a Permissionless Accountable RPC Protocol for
  Blockchain Networks
Summary (EN): In blockchain networks, so-called "full nodes" serve data to and relay
transactions from clients through an RPC interface. This serving layer enables
integration of "Web3" data, stored on blockchains, with "Web2" mobile or web
applications that cannot directly participate as peers in a blockchain ne ...

Title: Ideological Fragmentation of the Social Media Ecosystem: From echo
  chambers to echo platforms
Summary (EN): The entertainment-driven nature of social media encourages users to engage
with like-minded individuals and consume content aligned with their beliefs,
limiting exposure to diverse perspectives. Simultaneously, users migrate
between platforms, either due to moderation policies like de-platforming or ...

Title: Edge interventions can mitigate demographic and prestige disparities in
  the Computer Science coauthorship network
Summary (EN): Social factors such as demographic traits and institutional prestige
structure the creation and dissemination of ideas in academic publishing. One
place these effects can be observed is in how central or peripheral a
researcher is in the coauthorship network. Here we investigate inequities in
networ ...

Title: User Altruism in Recommendation Systems
Summary (EN): Users of social media platforms based on recommendation systems (RecSys)
(e.g. TikTok, X, YouTube) strategically interact with platform content to
influence future recommendations. On some such platforms, users have been
documented to form large-scale grassroots movements encouraging others to

Title: Risk Awareness in HTN Planning
Summary (EN): Actual real-world domains are characterised by uncertain situations in which
acting and using resources may entail the embracing of risks. Performing
actions in such domains involves costs of consuming some resource, such as time
or energy, where the knowledge about these costs can range from known  ...

Title: Zero-shot cross-modal transfer of Reinforcement Learning policies
  through a Global Workspace
Summary (EN): Humans perceive the world through multiple senses, enabling them to create a
comprehensive representation of their surroundings and to generalize
information across domains. For instance, when a textual description of a scene
is given, humans can mentally visualize it. In fields like robotics and

  Multi-Agent Environments
Summary (EN): Advances in large models, reinforcement learning, and open-endedness have
accelerated progress toward autonomous agents that can learn and interact in
the real world. To achieve this, flexible tools are needed to create rich, yet
computationally efficient, environments. While scalable 2D environment ...

Title: Rejecting Hallucinated State Targets during Planning
Summary (EN): Generative models can be used in planning to propose targets corresponding to
states that agents deem either likely or advantageous to experience. However,
imperfections, common in learned models, lead to infeasible hallucinated
targets, which can cause delusional behaviors and thus safety concerns. ...

Title: Reflection-Bench: Evaluating Epistemic Agency in Large Language Models
Summary (EN): With large language models (LLMs) increasingly deployed as cognitive engines
for AI agents, the reliability and effectiveness critically hinge on their
intrinsic epistemic agency, which remains understudied. Epistemic agency, the
ability to flexibly construct, adapt, and monitor beliefs about dynami ...

(LLMs) that leverages a single optimized image to override alignment safeguards
across diverse queries and even multiple models. By backpropagating through the
vision encoder and language head, we craft a synthetic image t ...
