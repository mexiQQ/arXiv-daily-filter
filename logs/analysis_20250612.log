Title: When Style Breaks Safety: Defending Language Models Against Superficial
  Style Alignment
Authors: Yuxin Xiao, Sana Tonekaboni, Walter Gerych, Vinith Suriyakumar, Marzyeh Ghassemi
Published: 2025-06-09T05:57:39Z

Summary: Large language models (LLMs) can be prompted with specific styles (e.g.,
formatting responses as lists), including in jailbreak queries. Although these
style patterns are semantically unrelated to the malicious intents behind
jailbreak queries, their safety impact remains unclear. In this work, we s ...
